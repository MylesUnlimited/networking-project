WELCOME!!!

This is our Computer Networking Term Project.

To get the code download a Python IDE of your choice and clone the repository.

HOW TO USE:

* Adjust the IP address at the top of the client and server files to your wifi IP address.
* Run the server (you should see a message in the run terminal letting you know the server is ready).
* Run the client on the same pc or another pc (on the server side you should see that the peer joined). Note: Both computers must be connected to the same network.
* On the client side type a message in the run terminal (U, R, D, E - These messages tell the server what you are trying to do).
* From there depending on the message you chose you may be required to give some additional information.

That's all! Connect multiple clients, send, request, register, and deregister files, the sky is the limit!
